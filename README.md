# AgentFi (ReAct Agent) – Work in Progress  

**AgentFi** is an intelligent financial assistant built using the **ReAct (Reasoning + Acting) framework**. It leverages **Ollama** and **LangChain** to provide enhanced financial insights, execute queries efficiently, and integrate **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** for contextual responses.  

## Key Features  

- **ReAct Agent Architecture:**  
  Uses the **ReAct framework** to combine reasoning and acting for better decision-making.  

- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG):**  
  Implements **RAG** to improve answer accuracy by fetching relevant data dynamically.  

- **Ollama Embeddings with LangChain:**  
  Integrates **Ollama embeddings** to enhance vector search capabilities in LangChain.  

- **Financial Data Processing:**  
  Designed to analyze financial datasets, interpret trends, and provide insights.  

- **API Integration:**  
  Supports **external API calls** for real-time stock data, financial news, and macroeconomic indicators.  

## Planned Enhancements  

- **Interactive Visualizations:**  
  Implement **Matplotlib** and **Plotly** for graphing stock trends and analysis results.  

- **Advanced Predictive Analytics:**  
  Use **machine learning models** to forecast stock movements based on historical data.  

- **Enhanced Memory & Context Handling:**  
  Improve long-term memory to store past interactions for a better user experience.  

- **Database Integration:**  
  Store and retrieve financial insights efficiently using a database backend.  

## Technologies Used  

- **LangChain & LangGraph** – For building modular AI-powered workflows.  
- **Ollama** – Enhances embeddings and retrieval efficiency.  
- **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** – Improves financial data retrieval.  
- **API Integrations** – Fetches real-time stock prices, news, and macroeconomic indicators.  
- **Python** – Core programming language for AI, API handling, and automation.  

## How It Works  

1. **User Query:**  
   - The user inputs a financial question (e.g., *"What is the DCF valuation for Tesla?"*).  

2. **Data Retrieval (RAG):**  
   - Relevant data is pulled using **RAG** from APIs, databases, and financial documents.  

3. **Ollama + LangChain Processing:**  
   - **Ollama embeddings** enhance understanding, and **LangChain** structures responses logically.  

4. **ReAct Agent Execution:**  
   - The **ReAct Agent** reasons through the query and takes action accordingly.  

5. **Final Response:**  
   - The agent returns a well-structured financial insight, supported by data.  

## Challenges Encountered  

- **Optimizing Response Speed:**  
  - Ensuring fast execution while processing large financial datasets.  

- **Improving Reasoning & Acting Balance:**  
  - Fine-tuning the **ReAct Agent** for more precise decision-making.  

- **Efficient API Usage:**  
  - Handling rate limits and optimizing API calls for real-time stock data.  

## What’s Next  

- **AI-Powered Portfolio Recommendations:**  
  - Generate **personalized investment strategies** based on user input.  

- **Sentiment Analysis for Market Trends:**  
  - Analyze **news sentiment** and its impact on stocks.  

- **Persistent Memory Storage:**  
  - Implement a database to **store user queries and past insights**.
