# AgentFi (ReAct Agent) – Work in Progress  

**AgentFi** is an AI-powered financial assistant that leverages the **ReAct (Reasoning + Acting) framework** with **LangGraph** for structured decision-making. Designed for financial analysis, stock valuation, and market insights, AgentFi integrates **Ollama embeddings, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), and real-time API calls** to provide deep, data-driven insights.  

By **modeling financial decision flows using LangGraph**, AgentFi enables more structured reasoning, allowing it to select the best tools dynamically for answering queries.

## Key Features  

### **State-Based Decision Modeling with LangGraph**  
- **LangGraph maps out the agent’s decision states**, allowing structured tool selection.  
- Models financial workflows, such as **data retrieval, valuation, and forecasting**.  
- Enables **multi-step reasoning** where decisions influence the next action dynamically.  

### **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for Market Data**  
- Implements **RAG** to fetch relevant **financial documents, earnings reports, and industry trends**.  
- Supports **vector search** using **Ollama embeddings** for better contextual retrieval.  

### **Ollama Embeddings for Enhanced Understanding**  
- Uses **high-dimensional vector search** for better recall of financial insights.  
- Enhances **multi-document summarization** to extract key market signals.  

### **DCF Valuation & Market Analysis**  
- Computes **Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) valuations** for stock analysis.  
- Supports **industry and macroeconomic trend analysis**.  

### **API-Driven Real-Time Data Fetching**  
- Fetches **live stock prices, economic indicators, and news sentiment** via APIs.  
- Supports **Yahoo Finance (yfinance), and custom data sources**.

## Planned Enhancements  

### **Interactive Graphing with Matplotlib & Plotly**  
- Visualize **stock trends, volatility, and financial ratios** dynamically.  
- Create **candlestick charts**, **moving averages**, and **correlation matrices**.  

### **AI-Driven Market Forecasting**  
- Train **machine learning models (LSTMs, Random Forests, XGBoost)** for predictive analytics.  
- Detect **trends, anomalies, and future price movements** based on historical data.  

### **Memory & Persistent Context Tracking**  
- Store **past queries and financial insights** for better user interaction.  
- Implement **LangGraph’s memory tracking** to **preserve decision states** between sessions.  

### **SQL/NoSQL Database Integration**  
- Store **historical stock performance, user queries, and investment recommendations**.  
- Enable **fast indexing and retrieval of financial insights**.

## How It Works  

**1) User Query Processing**  
   - User submits a request (e.g., *"What is the fair value of Tesla using DCF?"*).  

**2) State Modeling via LangGraph**  
   - LangGraph **determines the required tools** (e.g., data retrieval, valuation, sentiment analysis).  
   - The agent follows a **decision flow** to pick the best approach.  

**3) Data Retrieval (RAG & APIs)**  
   - Fetches **real-time stock data, financial reports, and macroeconomic indicators**.  

**4) Processing with LangChain & Ollama**  
   - Uses **Ollama embeddings** to enhance **financial document comprehension**.  
   - **ReAct Agent executes multi-step reasoning** to generate structured insights.  

**5) Final Response & Visualization**  
   - Outputs **detailed valuation metrics, market trends, and stock performance graphs**.

## Challenges Encountered  

### **Optimizing Decision Flow in LangGraph**  
- Fine-tuning **decision states** to **maximize efficiency and accuracy**.  
- Ensuring **dynamic tool selection without unnecessary computational overhead**.  

### **Balancing Model Complexity & Speed**  
- Keeping **financial reasoning deep** without slowing down response time.  
- Managing **large-scale embeddings for high-dimensional data retrieval**.  

### **Handling API Rate Limits**  
- Implementing **efficient caching strategies** to **minimize redundant API calls**.

## What’s Next for AgentFi?  

### **AI-Powered Portfolio Optimization**  
- Generate **personalized investment recommendations** based on risk tolerance.  
- Use **factor analysis** to **optimize stock weightings in a portfolio**.  

### **Sentiment Analysis & Market Trends**  
- Analyze **news sentiment and social media signals** for trading insights.  
- Implement **NLP-based earnings call analysis**.  

### **Long-Term Memory & Context Awareness**  
- Store **historical analysis and recommendations** for enhanced decision support.  
- Implement **continuous learning** for adapting to **market trends**.
